# Published benchmark results

These are end-to-end transform execution measurements, not isolated inner-loop
claims. Input generation happens before every timer; each section below states
its exact planning and output-materialization boundaries. PyWavelets uses its
normal allocating Python API.

## Apple M4 Max / NEON

Measured on macOS 15.6 with an Apple M4 Max using the runtime-selected NEON
backend. Both reports use Rust 1.98's release profile with no additional
`RUSTFLAGS`, Python 3.14.6, NumPy 2.5.2, and PyWavelets distribution 1.9.0
(whose module reports 1.8.0).

### Same-interpreter Python API

This report was generated from clean commit
`52a7ed1e4479ab75abf54a848f448dbf60b5ed4c`. Both implementations run in the
same CPython interpreter and receive the same NumPy inputs. The `planned` path
reuses a `wavelets-rs` plan. The deliberately conservative `cold` path creates
the canonical wavelet and plan inside every call, while PyWavelets receives a
preconstructed `pywt.Wavelet`. All paths create and destroy their outputs inside
the timed batch.

Signal length 4,096, db4, symmetric extension:

| Precision | Transform | `wavelets-rs` planned | `wavelets-rs` cold | PyWavelets | Py / planned | Py / cold |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| f64 | single forward | 2.79 us | 4.40 us | 9.86 us | 3.54x | 2.24x |
| f64 | single inverse | 2.60 us | 4.16 us | 6.32 us | 2.43x | 1.52x |
| f64 | multilevel forward | 7.52 us | 11.13 us | 31.19 us | 4.15x | 2.80x |
| f64 | multilevel inverse | 6.17 us | 9.67 us | 21.43 us | 3.48x | 2.22x |
| f32 | single forward | 1.60 us | 3.09 us | 9.48 us | 5.91x | 3.07x |
| f32 | single inverse | 1.42 us | 2.96 us | 6.23 us | 4.39x | 2.11x |
| f32 | multilevel forward | 4.52 us | 7.74 us | 30.93 us | 6.84x | 4.00x |
| f32 | multilevel inverse | 3.67 us | 6.90 us | 21.84 us | 5.94x | 3.16x |

The planned binding wins all 70 canonical cases, ranging from 1.77x to 8.42x
with a 3.54x median. The cold path wins 64 of 70, ranging from 0.86x to 4.73x
with a 2.14x median. Its six losses are short f64 single-level transforms of at
most 256 samples. Complete environment metadata, checksums, batch sizes, and
all 4,200 raw timing samples are in
[apple-m4-max-python-api.json](apple-m4-max-python-api.json).

### Native Rust API

The native report was generated from clean commit
`497327670c6881cec64c4e04913974dbddd83a80` (`wavelets` 0.1.0-alpha.4) and also
included GSL 2.8. Planning and wavelet construction are outside the timer. The
Rust `allocating` path allocates output on every call, while the Rust `into`
path reuses caller-owned output and scratch buffers.

Each number below is the median of 20 calibrated in-process samples targeting
10 ms apiece after three warmup batches. Checksums are validated between Rust's
two APIs and PyWavelets before a report is accepted. The complete 70-case matrix,
environment metadata, batch sizes, checksums, and all 216 sets of raw samples
are in [apple-m4-max-neon.json](apple-m4-max-neon.json).

#### Representative PyWavelets comparison

Signal length 4,096, db4, symmetric extension:

| Precision | Transform | Rust allocating | Rust `into` | PyWavelets | PyWavelets / `into` |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| f64 | single forward | 2.57 us | 2.24 us | 9.97 us | 4.45x |
| f64 | single inverse | 2.22 us | 1.94 us | 6.61 us | 3.40x |
| f64 | multilevel forward | 6.07 us | 5.11 us | 33.00 us | 6.46x |
| f64 | multilevel inverse | 4.68 us | 4.12 us | 21.86 us | 5.30x |
| f32 | single forward | 1.42 us | 1.23 us | 9.91 us | 8.04x |
| f32 | single inverse | 1.19 us | 998.62 ns | 6.57 us | 6.57x |
| f32 | multilevel forward | 3.35 us | 3.05 us | 32.47 us | 10.63x |
| f32 | multilevel inverse | 2.44 us | 2.15 us | 22.23 us | 10.33x |

Across all 70 canonical cases, PyWavelets divided by Rust `into` ranged from
2.34x to 32.98x, with a median of 4.65x. Small-signal ratios include the normal
fixed cost of crossing PyWavelets' Python API, so the representative table above
is a better guide for sustained transform work.

#### Strictly comparable GSL subset

GSL's public 1D API always computes a complete transform. The shared semantic
subset is therefore full-depth `f64` Haar with periodic extension, corresponding
to `wavelets` db1 with periodization. No other GSL cases are compared.

| Length | Direction | Rust `into` | GSL | GSL / Rust |
| ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1,024 | forward | 479.22 ns | 2.34 us | 4.89x |
| 1,024 | inverse | 535.92 ns | 2.21 us | 4.13x |
| 4,096 | forward | 1.73 us | 9.25 us | 5.36x |
| 4,096 | inverse | 1.95 us | 9.16 us | 4.71x |
| 16,384 | forward | 8.76 us | 47.54 us | 5.43x |
| 16,384 | inverse | 7.51 us | 43.03 us | 5.73x |

## x86_64 / AVX2

Representative physical-hardware results are pending. GitHub-hosted runners
exercise the benchmark harness but are virtualized, shared, and intentionally
excluded from the published performance matrix.

## Reproduction

From the repository root, install the pinned Python requirements and GSL, then
run:

```text
python3 -m pip install -r benchmarks/requirements.txt
python3 benchmarks/compare/compare.py \
  --gsl \
  --output benchmarks/reports/comparison.json
```

Omit `--gsl` if GSL is unavailable. The benchmark runner records the source
revision and dirty state automatically.

Build the Python extension and reproduce the same-interpreter report with:

```text
python3 -m venv python/.venv
python/.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r python/requirements-dev.txt
(cd python && .venv/bin/maturin develop --release)
python/.venv/bin/python benchmarks/compare/python_api.py \
  --output benchmarks/reports/python-api.json
```
