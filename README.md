# wavelets

`wavelets` is a plan-once, execute-many Rust implementation of the
one-dimensional discrete wavelet transform. Its boundary names, filter
orientation, and coefficient conventions follow PyWavelets, while reusable
plans provide allocation-free execution.

The crate is pre-release and intentionally narrow. The current correctness
slice includes:

- immutable, cheaply cloned filter banks;
- high-precision, reproducibly generated Haar and `db1..db38` filters;
- all nine PyWavelets boundary modes;
- fixed-length `f32` and `f64` DWT/IDWT plans;
- reusable allocation-free multilevel plans and contiguous decompositions; and
- exhaustive reconstruction, PyWavelets reference, orthogonality, and
  vanishing-moment tests.

The remaining built-in families, SIMD kernels, and published cross-library
benchmark results remain before the first beta.

The implementation invariants and deliberate departures from the initial
sketch are recorded in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Fuzzing

Fuzz targets live in the independent `fuzz/` workspace so nightly-only tooling
does not affect the library's MSRV. Install `cargo-fuzz`, then list or run the
targets with:

```text
cargo +nightly fuzz list
cargo +nightly fuzz run dwt_roundtrip -- -max_len=2051
cargo +nightly fuzz run wavedec_roundtrip -- -max_len=2051
cargo +nightly fuzz run custom_filter_bank -- -max_len=2051
```

Named seed corpora are checked in. New public subsystems should add a bounded
target using the shared decoders in `fuzz/src/lib.rs`; CI automatically builds
and smoke-tests every target returned by `cargo fuzz list` under its pinned
nightly toolchain.

## Performance

The repository's independent `benchmarks/` package keeps performance tooling
out of the library's dependency graph. Criterion measures uninstrumented
throughput and planning cost; an opt-in Hotpath driver profiles where
representative runs spend time and allocate.

```rust
use wavelets::{Boundary, DwtPlanner, Wavelet};

let signal = [1.0_f64, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0];
let wavelet = Wavelet::haar();
let mut planner = DwtPlanner::new();
let plan = planner.plan_dwt(signal.len(), &wavelet, Boundary::Symmetric)?;

let (approx, detail) = plan.forward(&signal);
let reconstructed = plan.inverse(&approx, &detail);
assert!(reconstructed
    .iter()
    .zip(signal)
    .all(|(actual, expected)| (actual - expected).abs() < 1e-12));

# Ok::<(), wavelets::WaveletError>(())
```

Reusable multilevel transforms allocate their coefficient and scratch storage
once:

```rust
use wavelets::{Boundary, DwtPlanner, Level, Wavelet};

let signal = [1.0_f64, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0];
let wavelet = Wavelet::haar();
let mut planner = DwtPlanner::new();
let plan = planner.plan_wavedec(
    signal.len(),
    &wavelet,
    Boundary::Symmetric,
    Level::Max,
)?;
let mut decomposition = plan.allocate_decomposition();
let mut reconstructed = vec![0.0; plan.signal_len()];
let mut scratch = vec![0.0; plan.scratch_len()];

plan.forward_into(&signal, &mut decomposition, &mut scratch);
plan.inverse_into(&decomposition, &mut reconstructed, &mut scratch);

# Ok::<(), wavelets::WaveletError>(())
```
