# wavelets

`wavelets` is a plan-once, execute-many Rust implementation of the
one-dimensional discrete wavelet transform. Its boundary names, filter
orientation, and coefficient conventions follow PyWavelets, while reusable
plans provide allocation-free execution.

The crate is pre-release and intentionally narrow. The current correctness
slice includes:

- immutable, cheaply cloned filter banks;
- high-precision, reproducibly generated Haar, `db1..db38`, `sym2..sym20`,
  `coif1..coif17`, and all PyWavelets `bior`/`rbio` filters;
- all nine PyWavelets boundary modes;
- PyWavelets-style `dwt`/`idwt` convenience functions and canonical name parsing;
- fixed-length `f32` and `f64` DWT/IDWT plans;
- safe portable SIMD analysis and synthesis with planner-cached runtime dispatch;
- reusable allocation-free multilevel plans and contiguous decompositions; and
- exhaustive reconstruction, PyWavelets reference, orthogonality, and
  vanishing-moment tests.

See [Migrating from PyWavelets](MIGRATING_FROM_PYWAVELETS.md) for the direct
API mapping, repeated-transform pattern, and current compatibility boundary.
The complete public API documentation is available on
[docs.rs](https://docs.rs/wavelets).

## PyWavelets-style API

The allocating facade keeps one-off transforms close to their PyWavelets
equivalents while delegating to the same planned kernels:

```rust
use wavelets::{Boundary, Wavelet, dwt, idwt};

let signal = [1.0_f64, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0];
let wavelet: Wavelet = "db2".parse()?;
let boundary: Boundary = "symmetric".parse()?;
let (approx, detail) = dwt(&signal, &wavelet, boundary)?;
let reconstructed = idwt(&approx, &detail, &wavelet, boundary)?;

# Ok::<(), wavelets::WaveletError>(())
```

Move to `DwtPlanner` when the signal length and transform configuration repeat.

## Fuzzing

Fuzz targets live in the independent `fuzz/` workspace so nightly-only tooling
does not affect the library's MSRV. Install `cargo-fuzz`, then list or run the
targets with:

```text
cargo +nightly fuzz list
cargo +nightly fuzz run dwt_roundtrip -- -max_len=2051
cargo +nightly fuzz run wavedec_roundtrip -- -max_len=2051
cargo +nightly fuzz run custom_filter_bank -- -max_len=2051
```

Named seed corpora are checked in. New public subsystems should add a bounded
target using the shared decoders in `fuzz/src/lib.rs`; CI automatically builds
and smoke-tests every target returned by `cargo fuzz list` under its pinned
nightly toolchain.

## Performance

The repository's independent `benchmarks/` package keeps performance tooling
out of the library's dependency graph. Criterion measures uninstrumented
throughput and planning cost; an opt-in Hotpath driver profiles where
representative runs spend time and allocate. A neutral in-process sampling
harness compares both Rust execution APIs with PyWavelets and the genuinely
compatible subset of GSL.

Published Apple M4 Max/NEON results are available with every raw timing sample
and the exact source revision in
[benchmarks/results](benchmarks/results/README.md). For a 4,096-sample `f64`
db4 transform with symmetric extension, the reusable-buffer API measured
3.01–3.52x faster than PyWavelets for a single level and 4.72–4.73x faster for
the complete multilevel transform. Representative x86_64/AVX2 results remain
pending access to physical hardware; shared-runner timings are deliberately not
presented as authoritative results.

```rust
use wavelets::{Boundary, DwtPlanner, Wavelet};

let signal = [1.0_f64, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0];
let wavelet = Wavelet::haar();
let mut planner = DwtPlanner::new();
let plan = planner.plan_dwt(signal.len(), &wavelet, Boundary::Symmetric)?;

let (approx, detail) = plan.forward(&signal);
let reconstructed = plan.inverse(&approx, &detail);
assert!(reconstructed
    .iter()
    .zip(signal)
    .all(|(actual, expected)| (actual - expected).abs() < 1e-12));

# Ok::<(), wavelets::WaveletError>(())
```

Reusable multilevel transforms allocate their coefficient and scratch storage
once:

```rust
use wavelets::{Boundary, DwtPlanner, Level, Wavelet};

let signal = [1.0_f64, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0];
let wavelet = Wavelet::haar();
let mut planner = DwtPlanner::new();
let plan = planner.plan_wavedec(
    signal.len(),
    &wavelet,
    Boundary::Symmetric,
    Level::Max,
)?;
let mut decomposition = plan.allocate_decomposition();
let mut reconstructed = vec![0.0; plan.signal_len()];
let mut scratch = vec![0.0; plan.scratch_len()];

plan.forward_into(&signal, &mut decomposition, &mut scratch);
plan.inverse_into(&decomposition, &mut reconstructed, &mut scratch);

# Ok::<(), wavelets::WaveletError>(())
```
